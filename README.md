# Guessing game
 # ðŸŽ® Number Guessing Game (Python)  This is a simple **number guessing game** built using Python.  The program randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**, and the user tries to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides hints to help the user get closer to the correct number.  ---  ## ðŸ§  How It Works  - The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100 using Pythonâ€™s `random` module. - The user inputs guesses until they get the correct number. - After each incorrect guess, the program gives a hint:   - "Lower number please" if the guess is too high   - "Higher number please" if the guess is too low - Once the correct number is guessed, the total number of attempts is displayed.  ---  ## ðŸ’» How to Run  1. Make sure Python is installed on your machine. 2. Save the code in a file, e.g., `guessing_game.py`. 3. Open terminal or command prompt, and run:  ```bash python guessing_game.py
